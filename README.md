This is the community-based admin system we made in class using asp.net core MVC 5 and C# as the main languages
Its purpose is to preserve the data of all members in 3 committees and assign the tasks to each member
We can use it to create an account and send notification via their email and have them reset their password to login or deactivate their account
We can use this project to maintain the meetings, reports information and also maintain people who attended the meetings
We have several roles in the project can assign roles to members and prevent them to access specific data
The CRUD operations are working in all pages and we can archive the data before delete a record if we want to
I can also design the website with CSS and modify the pages using html attributes
ASP.NET MVC 5 with C#, HTML and CSS are working well together is this project
